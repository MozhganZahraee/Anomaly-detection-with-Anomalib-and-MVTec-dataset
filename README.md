# Anomaly-detection-with-Anomalib-and-MVTec-dataset
 Finding anomaly products by PaDiM model. The goal of this project is to find defective products or anomalous pixels within the image. I performed this image-based anomaly detection by running Padim in the Anomalib library by using images of bottles in MVTec as my dataset. MVTec dataset compasses 5000 images of 15 categories. After training the model with images of normal products, I tested the model with images of both normal and defective products and observed the results in a test-result category that I had defined. In the result, we can see a heatmap, Grountruth, and the image of the product with the segmentation of the defection area if the image belongs to a defective product. The AUROC of the model is calculated from the ground truth and will show the ability of the model to classify products. The higher the AUC ROC the better the model to distinguish classes of input images.
